# ⏰ Digital Clock

A simple **digital clock** project built in two versions:

- 🌐 Web version using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- 🐍 GUI version using Python (tkinter)

---


## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as part of my learning journey in both **JavaScript** and **Python**.  
The goal was to create a clock that updates in real-time, using two different technologies:

- JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and update time dynamically in the browser  
- Python (with tkinter) to build a graphical desktop app

## 📁 Files

### 🌐 Web Version
Located in the main directory:
- `index.html` – Structure  
- `style.css` – Design  
- `script.js` – Logic  

### 🐍 Python GUI Version
Located in the `python file/` directory:
- `Digital-Clock.py` – GUI digital clock made with `tkinter`

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using `setInterval()` and `Date` in JavaScript  
- Styling and structuring a digital clock layout with HTML/CSS  
- Using `tkinter` to create a GUI window in Python  
- Working with `strftime()` and real-time updates using `after()` in tkinter
